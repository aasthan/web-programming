e-Vent app

The application will act as a simple feed, with minimal design and no login required so everyone can access it, given that they are connected to the internet. Information on the events includes: pictures/poster of event, description, date and type of events, and if time permits, an anti-scam feature (meaning: people can flag certain organization/organizer as “scam”). 
Users be able to filter the events based on colleges, dates, price etc. Students and organizations can also advertise their events, which will require them to create an account to further manage the events.


Please note that we run this application on localhost and run npm server. Please run npm on local host so that the app renders correctly
